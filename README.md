# Site Concept

A grid of everyone doing the choreography that Jamie taught us, looped. In the center is a bigger video of people doing other dances. When center video finishes, it cuts out and suddenly all of grid is replaced with everyone saying "Happy Birthday Jamie".

# Code TODOs

- loading screen to allow videos to buffer?
- grid of small looping videos around the screen (can fill in with proper videos later)
- larger video in the center
- hidden grid of happy birthday videos, allowed to buffer but paused
- when larger video finishes playing, hide current grid and show happy birthday hidden grid
- replace larger video with a happy birthday message + replay button maybe?
